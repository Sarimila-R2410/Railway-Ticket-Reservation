   Online Railway Ticket Reservation

This is a mini-project done during the 3rd semester of college to strengthen our knowledge of DBMS & OOPS.


Modules:
There are 2 modules:
User Login
Admin Login

User Login:
Here new user can create a user-id, or the existing customers can sign-in using their existing ids. In new user creation, the database is instantly updated and the user is redirected to sign-in option. Then the users can view the Trains listed and book the ticket to their destination.

Admin Login:
In this module, users cannot create a new user, this is to ensure the protection of data. Only admin can give a new user id to a new user. Admin can accesses all the modules and can add new Train in Database and can view all the Ticket Booking and Cancellation Details.

Tech Used
•	Java (OOPs)
•	SQL (DBMS)
•	JDBC (Connector between Java & SQL)
•	VS Code (Editor)
This application has no UI created and works on Console, as the goal of the project is to create a link between OOPS and DBMS.
